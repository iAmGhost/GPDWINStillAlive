# GPDWINStillAlive
This application does what exactly [GPD Wiin Keepalive](http://www.sakya.it/wordpress/?p=674) do, but write file only when certain process is running 

(So you don't have to turn on/off manually, just add it to Startup and forget about it)

## Build
Use [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com) for building.

## Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/iAmGhost/GPDWINStillAlive/releases) page.
